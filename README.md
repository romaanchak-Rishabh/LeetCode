# 🚀 LeetCode Solutions – Problem Solving Journey

Welcome to my LeetCode journey! This repository contains my **solutions** to all LeetCode problems, each accompanied by **detailed explanations**, code comments, and in many cases, **alternative approaches** or optimizations.

## 📚 About

I'm actively solving problems from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) to strengthen my grasp on **data structures**, **algorithms**, and **problem-solving patterns**. This repository serves as:
- A personal archive of my progress.
- A resource for others preparing for coding interviews.
- A growing collection of well-documented solutions in various topics.

## 🛠️ Languages Used

- C++ (primary)

Each folder is named by problem number and title (e.g., `001_Two_Sum/`), and contains:
- `solution.py` – main working solution
- `README.md` – problem description and explanation
- (Optional) multiple solution files if multiple methods are explored

---

## 📁 Directory Structure

Leetcode-Solutions/
│
├── 001_Two_Sum/
│ ├── solution.py
│ └── README.md ← explanation, time/space complexity
│
├── 002_Add_Two_Numbers/
│ ├── solution.py
│ └── README.md
│


Each folder is named with the problem number and title. Inside:
- `solution.py`: working, clean code
- `README.md`: problem explanation, thought process, and complexities
